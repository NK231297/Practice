const rakeshAccount = new BankAccount(`Rakesh K`, 1000);

rakeshAccount.setBalance(`hello`);

console.log(rakeshAccount); ok here is a code of a youtuber who was teaching about incapsulation in oop and he tell here is a flaw in this code which cause which means we can change balance outside of parent class if we write "rakeshAccount.balance = anything" then that will display as balance on browser even we entered balance manually so he says we put # in front of "balance" and from this if we type "rakeshAccount.#balance = anything" then the #balance would not be accessible from outside of parent class which is true because when i type "rakeshAccount.#balance" then a red line comes under that and error occured on browser but what my question is if i write like this "rakeshAccount.balance = 1000 or 2000 or anything" then it working and changing balance from outside of parent class.
