  “I love you sweetheart and this will never happen to you again” I said as I changed my voice for the third time.`,
  
  `My husband suggested we have dinner at my sister's for my birthday, as if I haven't noticed the two of them sneaking around my back for weeks.
  I swear I only brought the gun to scare them, but when my friends jumped out yelling "SURPRISE" I panicked.`,
  
  `My mom always told me to trust in calling the cops for serious emergencies.
  I can't really do that when the police are in on it, mom.`,
  
  `I wish we could play just one last game of floor is lava, the remorse-filled boy sobbed at his brother's funeral.
  Remember, I cannot bring back the dead, nor can I grant the same wish twice, the solemn genie reminded.`,
  
  `Daddy, why did you start painting my room blue?
  Because it's a nice color sweetie I say while I slip the crushed peanuts into her lunch.`,
  
  `The graffiti was a crude but effective way to mark local territory
  >!Everyone knew who's blood it was, as their screams echoed desperately throughout the night.!<`,
  
  `We buried her husband at dawn, and by dusk, she was already digging up his grave.
  I need him, she said through cracked lips, "I can't raise the baby alone."`,
  
  `Since becoming pregnant, Diana had felt a strange pain within her womb.
  She knew babies were meant to kick, but were they meant to scratch?`,
  
  `Don't worry, despite the execution being public, we always do our best to obscure the identity of the condemned.
  As the first step, we will anonymize your facial structure to give everyone a uniform "Hammer Smashed Face" look.`,
  
  `Women and children first the captain solemnly decided.
  We'll need as many well-fed men as possible to work the rigging if the ice does break`,
  
  `There was nothing I could do to save my daughter from the monster.
  After all, she went willingly, and was exactly 17 years and 366 days old.`,
  
  `The nursing home staff swore my mother’s screams were dementia
  until I found her IV bag labeled *"Liquid Nightmare, Trial #47."*`,
  
  `In two years, said the Chinese mystic, "you will die at work, on the factory floor."
  The eight year-old was jubilant he had so much time, with so many phones his tiny hands could still gift the world.`,
  
  `When I died, the Grim Reaper quickly shoved me into his car and floored the accelerator.
  I asked him what the rush was, and he replied while sweating “The scythe keeps them at bay, but not for long”`,
  
  `“Nobody likes me,” she whispered through tears, curled alone in the dark corner of her room.
  From beneath her bed, something impossibly tall and thin slid out, gently stroking her hair as it cooed, “That’s not true… I’ve always liked you.”`,
  
  `A photo of the girl you had an one night stand few days ago was on TV today and missing was written under her photo.
  Patient zero and highly contagious were also written.`,
  
  `Chained to the table, I carefully carved out a port into the man's abdomen.
  There I made a nest for the baby vultures I found abandoned near where he had run over the parents.`,
  
  `My best friend couldn't take her eyes off my husband's body.
  Keep trying, you lying bitch, I yelled, as she crawled blindly towards his corpse—to which I'd nailed her eyeballs after having gouged them out with a spoon.`,
  
  `When she got on top to ride me she pulled out a whip and spanked me repeatedly.
  If she does that shit again today I’m gonna buck her off straight into the electric fence and stamp my horseshoe into her forehead.`,
  
  `“My wife is pregnant, and we can’t be happier,” my friend beamed, taking a sip of his beer.
  And she still helps out around the house, always insisting to clean out the cat litter.`,

  They found the campers in the morning overcome by fumes`,
  
  `One night, my mother warned me not to go to the forest.
  Deciding to investigate, the only thing I saw was a figure hanging from her neck.`,
  
  `[April25] "Do you think I'm stupid as well as blind?"
  I tightened my hands on my dying boyfriend's throat, "I know that was you changing your voice, your cologne reeks, and you never took out those piercings."`,
  
  `At first I dismissed the tornado warnings as mere speculation because tornadoes don't happen in Colorado.
  But when I looked out the window my last thought was 'that is not a tornado'`,
  
  `Good, you're finally hard,  She said playfully, stroking his arms and the tips of his fingers.
  Suddenly, the crack of breaking bones shattered her fantasy, prompting her to hastily slam the freezer door.`,
  
  `My previously sweet, loving husband beat me unconcious when he found out our daughter had none of his DNA.
  But that was nothing compared to the pain when we discovered she had none of mine either.`,
  
  `Put a baby in that man! The figure ordered.
  Guess I should be glad they still called me a man after they found out my secret.`,
  
  `Oneday he and his twin decided to switch names and fool everyone for that day.
  At the middle of the night his parents woke him up and told him to follow them to the escape pod without waking up his brother.`,
  
  `You never really know someone until you get a little vulnerable with them, until you hand them your trust like a lamb to the knife and pray they don't bite.
  When I woke up gagged in her basement, ribs cracked open like rotten wood and my own tongue stitched into the wound as a 'thank you,' I realized she hadn't even shown me the worst yet.`,
  
  `Whenever that blue light is on it means someone wants to be let into the pen.
  Whatever colour the other one is means they’re coming back out.`,
  
  `Don't mind grandpa—he just has trouble telling screens apart from windows, my grandma said, watching him knock on the television.
  What's a window? I thought, looking around the bunker I'd been born in.`,
  
  `My little brother told me the man in the closet has my face but "wrong eyes."
  Tonight, I woke up to my own reflection blinking from inside the closet door.`,
  
  `She loved baking cookies for the neighborhood kids, always remembering everyone’s favorite flavor.
  That way, she could keep track of which ones were allergic to what, just in case.`,
  
  `Suicide doesn’t scare me. 
  Until I think about it, and smile.`,
  
  `“Oh, you’re awake!” I mumble sleepily in bed as I turn around and face you.
  But I immediately feel my stomach twist when I noticed you haven’t blinked in a while….`,
  
  `Oh, if only these walls could talk' said the young woman said, sliding her hand against the walls of the old home she intended on buying.
  Oh, the things we would warn you of, I thought in return.`,
  
  `When our daughter went missing, my husband Josef comforted me every night.
  So imagine my pain when I found out not only had Josef kidnapped our daughter, but she’d been in our basement the entire fucking time.`,
  
  `When the psychic told me that she foresaw a fire big and hot enough to burn everything in the world, I laughed in her face.
  Two weeks later I got a call that my wife's formerly pregnant body had been found in a car crash with the cause of death having been, "Trapped inside an overturned vehicle and burned alive."`,
  
  `I felt so free as I waved my husband off when he set off on his work trip.
  Once I was sure he'd gone, I tiptoed down to the basement to continue torturing the affair partner he thought he was meeting at the hotel.`,
  
  `“I thought you said you wanted this?” The voice spoke as cold, boney fingers touched my skin.
  “I do” were my last, weak words as Death himself finally embraced my fear and led my soul from my tortured body.`,
  
  `I watched as my toddler set tiny plates for her tea party and poured invisible cups of tea, asking her imaginary friend if they wanted one lump of sugar or two.
  Then she paused, shook her head solemnly, and said, “No, we can’t kill Mommy because she makes us snacks.”`,
  
  `My wife waved at me cheerfully through the opening portal--she was laughing with immense ecstasy--as I waited in Purgatory for the destination portal to Mars open up behind me.
  And when the opening portal closed, I waited for the destination portal to open up.`,
  
  `I told the genie that my wish was for the person holding me back from everything I want in life to die a slow, painful death.
  I don't think it worked because not only is everyone still alive and well, but now my doctor says I have terminal cancer.`,
  
  `What happened?! she screamed, seeing her husband's car pull into the driveway, dented and covered in blood.
  He hit me, so I hit him back—harder, gnarled the deer, sliding out from behind the wheel.`,

  `James, on his fifth bottle of the night, clutched up with hazy excitement when he saw that he finally recieved a signal from space.

  `I'm only selling my body to make money, I tell the detective.
  You're harvesting your clones' organs!`,
  
  `“Two of you must play Russian roulette but one of you must die” the masked man said

  `Waking up after hearing my dogs’ cries, I looked down from my window and saw my dog’s dead body.
  As I was able to rush down the stairs to the main door, my husband grabbed my arm and said     “ Don’t, I saw some people hiding in the bushes“`,
  
  `At the dinner I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong with the family dog lying and breathing heavily under the table.
  A boy sitting next to me suddenly whispered into my ear anxiously that it wasn't a dog, it's the operations that made her like this.`,
  
  `I came back to see my helper robot telling me "task complete, 'baby' has been fed"
  I happily walked up the stairs, because what I didn't see is the empty jar of honey on the counter that wasn't there when I left`,
  
  `I laughed when the fortune teller told me my beloved son would be the death of me.
  I wasn't laughing anymore as I felt my ribs crack under my son's desperate hands.`,
  
  `What happened?! she screamed, seeing her husband's car pull into the driveway, dented and covered in blood.
  He hit me, so I hit him back—harder, gnarled the deer, sliding out from behind the wheel.`,
  
  `I love my wife.
  I know that, as long as I only give very little money each check, she'll never be able able to run away.`,
