At night, the urn screamed to be let out`,

He lived alone`,

The reflection kept watching him anyway`,

It hadn’t aged`,  

`He woke up buried alive, phone at 1%—with a selfie he didn’t take`,

She smiled and kept shoveling`,

`She heard her dead twin calling from the basement.  
They were never buried`,  

`He downloaded a white noise app.  
The static said his name`,  

`The tooth under her pillow was replaced… by a note that read, “Not done collecting.”`,  

`She scratched her back in the shower.  
The thing under her skin purred`,  

`The elevator stopped on the 13th floor.  
Her building only had 12`,  

`She dug up the time capsule they buried in fifth grade.  
Inside was today’s newspaper with her obituary`,  

`Every light in the hallway turned off behind him.  
One turned back on ahead`,

It had today’s date`,

The timestamp was tomorrow`,  

`His daughter’s drawings started showing a man watching her sleep.  
The man wore his face`,  

`She found a second reflection in the window—smiling when she wasn’t`,  

`Every morning she woke up with one more finger than the day before`,  

`His wife hummed a lullaby in her sleep.  
He recognized it from the night his mother died`,  

`The forest grew back overnight—along with the missing hikers`,  

`Her doorbell rang at 3 a.m.  
A note slid under the door: “Let me back in”`,  

`He saw his son outside the window, begging to come in.  
His son was already asleep in bed`,  

`The scarecrow moved only when no one looked at it`,  

`She gave her doll a name.  
That night, the doll gave itself a mouth`,

`Her therapist told her the voice wasn’t real.  
The voice whispered, “Kill him first”`,  

`The storm knocked the power out.  
The TV turned itself on anyway`,  

`He opened a book in the library.  
The pages were filled with detailed memories he’d forgotten`,  

`Every clock in her house reset to midnight.  
Time hasn’t moved since`,  

`She read her dream journal aloud.  
Something started knocking from under the bed`,  

`His mirror smiled at him.  
He didn’t smile back`,  

`The shadows on the wall kept multiplying`,  

`His wife sang lullabies to the baby every night.  
The baby had died years ago`,  

`The black mold spelled his name across the ceiling`,  

`She whispered her wish into the wishing well.  
Something whispered back, “Granted”`,  

`Every person in his family portrait blinked—except him`,  

`Her phone recorded her sleep.  
It played eight hours of her screaming`,  

`He removed the earplugs.  
The whispers didn’t stop`,  

`Her car’s back seat always seemed more full when she drove home at night`,  

`He unboxed the antique doll.  
It was warm`,  

`Her grandma’s rocking chair creaked—upstairs.  
She was buried last week`,  

`The new tenant never arrived.  
But someone moved into Apartment 6B`,  

`He dreamed of drowning.  
He woke up with water in his lungs`,
